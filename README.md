🎋 **Intro:**
This project is a weather application that provides current weather data and a 7-day forecast for any city. It allows users to search for a city and get detailed weather information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

📦 **Tech Stack:**
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- React
- Axios (for API requests)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)

👩🏽‍🍳 **Features:**
- Search for a city to get current weather data and a 7-day forecast.
- Display current temperature, feels like temperature, min/max temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure.
- Show sunrise and sunset times.
- Visual weather icons that change based on the weather conditions.
- Responsive design with a beautiful gradient background.
- Globe component to display an interactive globe (visible on larger screens).

💭 **Process:**
The project started by setting up a Next.js application and integrating the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data. The experience involved creating reusable components for different parts of the weather data, such as the current weather, forecast, and detailed weather information. One of the challenges was ensuring the application is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes. The use of Jotai for state management made it easier to manage the selected city across different components.

📚 **Learnings:**
- Gained experience with making API requests using Axios.
- Improved understanding of Next.js and its server-side rendering capabilities.
- Enhanced skills in creating responsive designs with Tailwind CSS.
